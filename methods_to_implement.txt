##### Contact XML Interfaces
    The following section defines the interfaces provided to manage the most common Mailing and Database
    management actions. We refer to these as Contact Actions because each relates directly to one or more
    Contacts.

### Mailing Management Interfaces
    Mailing Management interfaces allow you to invoke Engage functions directly related to particular mailings.
    There are two operations in this category: SendMailing and ForwardToFriend.

        SendMailing
        ForwardToFrield
        GetContactMailingDetails
        PurgeData

### Database Management Interfaces - Contact
    Database Management Interfaces allow you to invoke Engage functions directly related to database contacts.

        UpdateRecipient
        OptOutRecipient
        SelectRecipientData

##### User XML Interfaces
    This section defines the automation interfaces for importing and/or updating databases from external files. We
    refer to these as User Actions.

### Automation - User
    Engage supports two great Programs APIs that allow you to discover what Programs are available to a given
    database and also how an individual contact has interacted with a program.


        GetPrograms
        GetProgramsByContact

### Scoring Models - User
    Engage supports two great Scoring Model APIs that allow you to discover what Scoring Models are available to a
    given database and also what scores an individual contact has within that Scoring Model.


        GetScoringModels
        GetContactScores

### Reporting Interfaces - User
    Engage archives mailing tracking data after 450 days by default. You can modify this setting to reduce the
    number of days before archiving, but 450 is the maximum setting. For Autoresponders, if the SEND or ACTION
    date ranges specified are greater than 450 days (or the number of days configured for archiving), you will receive
    an error message (returned from the call) specifying that the mailing was archived. If the date range spans both
    archived and available data for the mailing, Engage will return only the data available and will not return archived
    data.
    If your Organization will frequently requests data older than 30-60 days, we recommend leaving the archive
    setting at 450 days. As a best practice, try to refrain from requesting data older than one year to avoid including
    archived data in an export date range.
